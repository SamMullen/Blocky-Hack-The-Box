Blocky = 10.10.10.37
First, we connect to the VPN, then edit our /etc/hosts file to include 10.10.10.37 blocky.htb
I verified connectivity via ping blocky.htb
-------------------------
-------------------------
Now, let's nmap blocky on all ports to see what we can attack
nmap -p- blocky.htb

open ports/services
	21/tcp ftp
	22/tcp ssh
	80/tcp http
	8192/tcp closed sophos
	25565 minecraft

Now, let's do a deeper scan for service version and standard scripts for each of these ports
└─$ nmap -p 21,22,80,8192,25565 -sV -sC blocky.htb
	PORT      STATE  SERVICE   VERSION

Taking a look at the website on port 80, there isn't much, but there is a login that takes us to http://blocky.htb/wp-login.php
This is a wordpress login screen
Using Wapalyzer, I see it is running wordpress 4.8
I briefly tried some default passwords including defaults that I found online
no default credentials working

I found this (https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/wordpress-4-8-x-possible-sql-injection-vulnerability-4-8-4-8-2/) article claiming that a SQL injection is possible.

Next, I ran scanner/http/wordpress_login_enum in MSFConsole, which found the user "Notch"

I am running a bruteforce using the username Notch from burpsuite via the intruder tool and the top 500 passwords list I found on Github

This returned with failure

During some research, I located wpscan, a commandline tool specifically designed for wordpress sites
I ran wpscan --url http://blocky.htb/ -e ap
this points me to /plugins, where I can download two files

I opened BlockyCore.jar first via jd-gui and located some interesting information
	sqlUser = root
	sqlPass = 8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22
-------------------------
-------------------------
With the two users I have, and a password, I am going to try the other services and logins

Notch:8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22 works on ssh!
I run sudo -l and notch can run all commands as sudo.
and we find the user flag here in /home/notch/user.txt

I don't see any signs of the root flag in this file system anywhere else

since Notch can run anything as sudo a simple "sudo su -" swaps us over to root user
and we end up in /root where we find root.txt!
